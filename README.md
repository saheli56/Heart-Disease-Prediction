# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

A Machine Learning project to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using healthcare data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project applies various ML algorithms to classify whether a person is likely to suffer from heart disease based on medical attributes like cholesterol, blood pressure, age, and more.

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source**: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
* **Features**: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting BP, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG, Max HR, Exercise-induced Angina, ST Depression, etc.

---

## 🧠 Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report
* ROC Curve & AUC

---

## 📁 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saheli56/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Run all cells sequentially
```

---

## 📌 Outcomes

* Visualized data distributions and correlations
* Built and compared multiple ML classifiers
* Identified the best-performing model based on accuracy and ROC AUC
